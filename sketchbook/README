These are Arduino Sketches that assist in development and debugging.  To use,
first re-flash the ATMEGA8U2 with the stock Arduino DFU and Serial firmware.
Then open the Arduino IDE and change the Sketchbook location (in Preferences)
to this directory.  Restart the IDE, then choose and upload sketches.  Finally, 
re-flash the ATMEGA8U2 with the femulator firmware.
