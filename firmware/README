Femulator - Traktor Kontrol F1 emulator for Arduino

This firmware, when loaded onto an Arduino UNO, will appear in the OS as a
Traktor Kontrol F1 instead of a USB Serial device.  This allows it to send and
receive signals to and from Traktor Pro 2.5's Remix Decks.  When used in
conjuction with the Femulator software, it allows full control of the remix
decks from any MIDI device. 

To build the firmware:
---
1. Install an AVR development environment, including gcc-avr, avr-libc, make, and avrdude
2. Download LUFA version 100807 from http://fourwalledcubicle.com/LUFA.php
3. Extract LUFA into this directory and rename as ./LUFA
4. Type "make"

To program firmware using an in-system programmer:
---
1. Edit Makefile and set AVRDUDE_PROGRAMMER and AVRDUDE_PORT
2. Connect ISP programmer to the UNO's ATMEGA8U2 ISP header (not the ATMEGA328!)
3. Type "make program" 

To program firmware using dfu-programmer via dfu-programmer or Flip:
---
1. Put the 8U2 into USB DFU mode:
2. Assert and hold the 8U2's RESET line
3. Assert and hold the 8U2's HWB line
4. Release the 8U2's RESET line
5. Release the 8U2's HWB line
6. Confirm that the board enumerates as either "Arduino Uno DFU" or "Arduino Mega 2560 DFU"
7. Type "make dfu" (OS X or Linux) or "make flip" (Windows)
