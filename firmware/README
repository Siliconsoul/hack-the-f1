Femulator - Traktor Kontrol F1 emulator for AVR

This firmware, when loaded onto an Arduino, Teensy, or other LUFA-supported target, 
will appear in the OS as a Traktor Kontrol F1.  This allows it to send and receive signals
to and from Traktor Pro 2.5's Remix Decks.  When used in conjuction with the Femulator software,
it allows full control of the remix decks from any MIDI device. 

It has been developed and tested using an Arduino UNO / ATMEGA8U2.

To build the firmware:
---
1. Install an AVR development environment, including gcc-avr, avr-libc, make, and avrdude
2. Get the latest LUFA trunk (https://github.com/abcminiuser/lufa) into ./LUFA
3. Edit the makefile for your BOARD and MCU
4. Type "make"

To program firmware using an in-system programmer:
---
1. Edit Makefile and set AVRDUDE_PROGRAMMER and AVRDUDE_PORT
2. Connect ISP programmer to the device's ISP header.
3. Type "make avrdude" 

Note, if flashing an UNO, use the ISP header for the ATMEGA8U2 (solder it yourself).  Don't use the ISP
header for the ATMEGA328, or you'll overwrite the Arduino bootloader.

To program firmware using dfu-programmer or flip:
---
1. Put the 8U2 into USB DFU mode:
2. Assert and hold the 8U2's RESET line
3. Assert and hold the 8U2's HWB line
4. Release the 8U2's RESET line
5. Release the 8U2's HWB line
6. Confirm that the board enumerates as DFU 
7. Type "make dfu" (OS X or Linux) or "make flip" (Windows)
