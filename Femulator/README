Femulator is an application for mapping MIDI and communicating with the
Femulator Hardware to control Traktor remix decks.  For more information,

To Build
---
This application uses the Netbeans Platform 2.7.1 and is easly built using the
Netbeans IDE (http://netbeans.org/downloads):

1. Get the source from http://github.com/angryelectron/hack-the-f1
2. Using the Netbeans IDE, open the ./hack-the-f1/Femulator project
3. Clean and Build 

To build the application without the Netbeans IDE you will need Apache Ant and
the Java 1.7 SDK:

1. Get the source from http://github.com/angryelectron/hack-the-f1
2. Change to ./hack-the-f1/Femulator
2. Run 'ant -f configure.xml' to download and configure the Netbeans platform.
3. Run 'ant create-platform' to create the application in ./dist. 

Once the platform has been downloaded, it will also be used if this project is
opened in the IDE.  To use the stock platform bundled with the IDE, run "ant -f
configure.xml clean", then re-open the Femulator project in the IDE.  

Here are some other useful Ant targets:

* "ant run" - build and run the application
* "ant build-zip" - build and create a zip-distribution in ./dist
* "ant -f configure.xml" - download and configure the Netbeans platform
* "ant -f configure.xml clean" - remove the downloaded Netbeans platform
